    <string name="text_general_info">The CoWApp (Corona Warning App) is an application that anyone can use to further contain the spread of the coronavirus. \nWith it potential contact with corona-infected people can be determined in everyday life and an infection risk can be calculated. It is displayed by the traffic light principle and a risk value of 1 to 100. \nYou will also receive a push notification when a potential health risk has been identified so you know how to act correctly to protect yourself and those around you. \nUnder Suspicion? you can receive information on what to do if you suspect an infection, in the info menu further information.</string>

    <string name="short_Risk_Level_Info_Head">What is the risk level?</string>
    <string name="short_Risk_Level_Info_Text">The risk level is a numerical value between 0 and 100,\nwhich the CoW-App calculates for you.\nThe risk value represents through a number how likely it is that you have been infected with the Covid-virus in the last 14 days.</string>
    <string name="head_traffic_light_info">Explanation of the Traffic Light</string>
    <string name="text_traffic_light_info">For further clarity and how the user should best behave, the CoW-App divides and simplifies the risk level via the traffic light display.</string>
    <string name="head_traffic_light_green">Green Traffic Light</string>
    <string name="text_traffic_light_green">A risk value less than 35 (i.e. 0 – 34) results in a green traffic light color, which signals to the user that an infection is very unlikely and that he can therefore be unconcerned. Notice: A risk level of 0 does not rule out an infection!</string>
    <string name="head_traffic_light_yellow">Yellow Traffic Light</string>
    <string name="text_traffic_light_yellow">A value between 35 and 70 results in a yellow traffic light color, which means that an infection is already possible but not very likely.\nIf the risk level is in the lower range, close to 35,\nan infection is unlikely. If the risk level is close to the value of 70,\nthe possibility of an infection is more likely.</string>
    <string name="head_traffic_light_red">Red Traffic Light</string>
    <string name="text_traffic_light_red">A risk level above 70 causes the traffic light to turn red, indicating a high probability of infection.</string>
    <string name="head_risk_level_calculation_info">Explanation of the Calculation</string>
    <string name="text_risk_level_calculation_info">To understand the calculation the following terms should be clarified first.\n\n<u>Contact</u>: A so-called contact was determined by the exchange of keys between end devices.\n\nOnly contacts with persons who have already been exchanged at the time of an infection report are included in the risk level calculation.\n\nThese contacts are further specified by evaluating them as either direct or indirect contact.\n\n<u>Direct contact</u>: means that there has been contact with a person reported as infected.\n\n<u>Indirect contact</u> means a contact with a person who is not reported as infected itself, but has had contact with a third person who is reported as infected To calculate the risk level.\n\nAll direct and indirect contacts as well as the user\'s self-infection report from the last 14 days are taken into account.\n\nThe Duration of the contacts is also included in the calculation.\nFor this purpose, long contacts are converted into several short contacts.\n\nAn existing infection is signaled by a value of 100.</string>

    <string name="question12">Why does the CoW-App need my location?</string>
    <string name="question13">Which personal data are saved by the CoW-App?</string>
    <string name="answer1">The CoW-App helps to defeat the Coronavirus. It documents the encounter between two smartphones and makes it possible to identify contact chains and warn people quickly if the have had contact with a person who was tested Corona-positive. The faster people are informed about this, the faster they can take appropriate steps and avoid unnecessarily infecting many more people. This is why the app is a useful tool for combating the Coronavirus together with all other measures.</string>
    <string name="answer2">The CoW-App informs you if you have had contact with someone who later was tested positive for corona. In addition, you will be provided with recommendations for actions, which will enable you to behave accordingly and avoid the further spread of the Coronavirus. The tracking of infection chains, which is otherwise done manually and takes a long time, can therefore be accelerated significantly with the CoW-App. If installed, the app runs in the background on your smartphone and exchanges random-ID-codes with other smartphones in the vicinity in order to make it possible to identify the contact person and the chain of infection. From these random-ID-codes it is not possible to deduce who the users are or where the transmission took place.</string>
    <string name="answer3">The CoW-App uses Bluetooth technology and measures the distance and duration of contact with other users of the app you meet. When there is an encounter, random-ID-codes are then exchanged in order to document the encounter. If a person is tested Corona-positive, they can voluntarily report their infection anonymously via the app. In this case, the collected random-ID-codes of the person are transmitted to the server and made available there for contact determination. Once you have installed the app, it will regularly check for you whether you have met people who were tested positive for corona. This check takes place via a request to the server. Your risk level will be recalculated based on the results of these checks and you will be warned if necessary. Your anonymity is preserved throughout the whole process. Neither your identity nor your location can be determined. \n \nThe App is currently available in the following two languages: German and English.</string>
    <string name="answer4">By using the App, you contribute to the fight against Corona and prevent other people from suffering unnecessarily. By using the App, you can quickly find out if you have had contact with an infected person and thus protect those around you by quarantining yourself or taking appropriate steps.</string>
    <string name="answer5">The CoW-App is a project on behalf of the University Heilbronn. The Hopper GmbH developed the application based on a central software architecture.</string>
    <string name="answer6">Your current risk-status is derived from your personal risk level. To calculate the risk level the following is considered: direct or indirect contacts with people who later tested positive for corona. \nThe different risk-statuses are: \n \nlow risk: \nNo contact could be established. Information is provided about generally applicable distance regulations and hygiene recommendations. \n \nmoderate risk: \nIt was found that in the last 14 days there was at least one indirect contact with a person who was later tested as corona-positive. It is recommended to avoid unnecessary meetings with other people. \n \nhigh risk: \nIt was found that in the last 14 days there was at least one direct contact with a person who was later tested as Corona-positive. It is recommended to go home or to stay at home and to contact the family doctor, the medical on-call service on 116117 or the health department by phone and agree on how to proceed. \n \ncurrent infection: \nThe person reported himself infected. It is recommended to go home or to stay at home and to contact the family doctor, the medical on-call service on 116117 or the health department by phone and agree on how to proceed. </string>
    <string name="answer7">If someone with whom you have been in contact reports themselves as infected, you will be warned within half an hour at the latest. Whether a person reports themselves infected or not is voluntary and depends entirely on that person. In order to report as infected, the person must press the "Report infection" button in the app and then confirm.</string>
    <string name="answer8">The application runs in the background to save batteries. Care was taken to develop the app in a way that saves batteries and storage space.</string>
    <string name="answer9">The protection of your privacy is a top priority for the Hopper GmbH. Therefore, users do not have to register in order to use the App. Everything takes place anonymously and all data will be deleted after a maximum of 14 days.</string>
    <string name="answer10">No. The "high risk" warning simply means that direct contact has been made with someone who later reported infected. It is recommended that the user contact his family doctor, the medical on-call service 116 117 or the health department by telephone. A sick leave or a quarantine order is made by the family doctor or the health department</string>
    <string name="answer11">The risk level is represented by a value between 1 (low risk) and 100 (infected). When calculating the risk level, the following three factors are considered: direct contacts, indirect contacts and the infection-report. The risk level is used to provide the user with a more specific picture of the situation and the risk-status is then derived from this risk level. If the risk level was lower than 35, no contact could be found. In the range between 35 and 69, only indirect contacts were found. Direct contacts were found in the range between 70 and 95, but the user has not yet reported himself to be infected. The value 100 means that the user has reported himself infected.</string>
    <string name="answer12">The authorization to use the location is technically necessary to use the Bluetooth technology. The location of a user is never read out or used in any way.</string>
    <string name="answer13">Your personal data are safe all the time. You are anonymous when you use the App. To use the App, you do not have to register. All data – for example an encounter with other people, which are using this app – are saved anonymous and just for a short period of time. There are short-lived random-ID-codes from other smartphones saved, when you encounter them. In case of an infection you can voluntarily share your collected random-ID-codes and provide them to the server. With this data the server can determine encounters and warn people which had contact to someone, who later was tested Corona-positive. There is no data saved or read, which can be used to identify a user. It is sure that: A person tested Corona-positive will not know, who was warned because of a contact to him. The contact persons will not know who the person with Corona was. </string>
