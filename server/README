--- Instruction: How to run the server ---
------------------------------------------

1. To start the 'server.js' file you must have Node.js installed.
   (Download website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. After you've installed Node.js, install the 'express' and 'mongodb' modules via the commands:
       - "npm install express" and
       - "npm install mongodb"
   without the "" in the terminal.
   These modules as the same for Node.js are only needed to be installed once.

3. After these modules are installed, you can run the server by navigating to the 'server' folder
   and run
       - "node server.js"
   again without the "" in the terminal.

4. Now the 'server.js' file should start listening on Port 3000 on your local host and the
   client-server-communication of CoWApp by using an emulated Android-Phone should work

5. If you want to run CoWApp on a real Android-Phone, you have to make sure that your phone and
   your computer, on which you're running the server, are connected to the same internet. After that
   go the 'MainActivity' class of the project and change the value of the variable 'BASE_URL' to
   "http://'OWN_IP':3000", you need to replace 'OWN_IP' with the ip-address of your computer on which
   your running the server on. To get the ip you can type
       - "ipconfig" if you are on a windows pc, or
       - "ifconfig" if you are on a mac or a linux pc
   again without the "" in the terminal.
